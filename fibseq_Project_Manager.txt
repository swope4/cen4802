Fibseq program is the java program that writes the 10th term of the fibonacci sequence
//**\\//**\\//**\\//**\\//**\\//**\\//**\\//**\\//**\\//**\\//**\\//**\\//**\\//**\\//*\
In this program we have the class Fibseq run by the main method 
and determined by the static method (lowercase fibseq) fibseq.
since in the process of recursive methods we are able to run 
the fib sequece by just returning the added methods with 
paramiters included to n-1 and n-2. This in turn adds them
together and produces the numbers sequecially until we get 
our desired term declared in the main. using standard output 
method the nth (in our case 10th) term is produced. 
Although this program runs it does not contain javadoc implementation 
and remains with flaws. The updated request will contain the this
implementation.
